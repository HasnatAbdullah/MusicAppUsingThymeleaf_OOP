Launch your terminal.

Type npm i http-server and hit Enter.
Go to the root folder and open it.
In this case, the root folder is where you want to store your files.

 Type http-server ./
You will see something like  http://localhost:8080 on the output screen of your terminal.
You can retrieve everything stored here.
For example, an image file named deepen.png can be retrieved using
background: url('https://localhost:8080/deepen.png');
